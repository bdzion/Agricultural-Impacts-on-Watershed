# Agricultural-Impacts-on-Watershed
This repository contains data analysis scripts, processed datasets, and visualization outputs developed in collaboration with the Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority (ABCA) to assess the hydrologic and water-quality impacts of agricultural activities in a Lake Huron tributary watershed. The project integrates long-term monitoring data (2011–2023) on streamflow, precipitation, temperature, and nutrient concentrations (e.g., NO₃, TN, DRP, TP, TSS) to quantify mass export loads, flow-weighted mean concentrations, and temporal variability in nutrient dynamics.

Analytical workflows were built using Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and include:
Time-series analysis of hydrologic and water-quality trends.
Correlation and regression modeling to identify linkages among flow, precipitation, and nutrient transport.
Machine learning (Gradient Boosting Regression) for feature importance analysis and predictive modeling of nutrient loads.
Data imputation and interpolation for continuous monthly datasets (2011–2021).

Findings highlight the increasing role of precipitation and temperature in nutrient transport and the need to adapt Best Management Practices (BMPs)—such as controlled drainage and cover cropping—to mitigate nutrient export under changing climatic conditions.
